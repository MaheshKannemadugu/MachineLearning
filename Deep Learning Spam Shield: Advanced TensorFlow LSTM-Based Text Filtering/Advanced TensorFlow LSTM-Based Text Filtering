TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)

TfidfVectorizer is a tool from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module used to convert a collection of text documents into a matrix of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features.

TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents (corpus). It is computed as:

TF-IDF(ùë°,ùëë)=TF(ùë°,ùëë)√óIDF(ùë°)TF-IDF(t,d)=TF(t,d)√óIDF(t)

where:
TF (Term Frequency): How frequeny a term appears in a document.
IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Measures how common or rare a term is across all documents in the corpus. Words that appear in many documents have lower IDF.
max_features=5000 limits the number of features (i.e., words) to the top 5000 most important words across all documents. It ensures that the feature matrix will not have more than 5000 columns 
(i.e., no more than 5000 unique words will be considered).

model.add(Dropout(0.5))
--------------------------
Dropout(0.5): This line adds a dropout layer, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting during training.
0.5: This is the dropout rate. It means that during training, half (50%) of the neurons in this layer will be randomly "dropped" (i.e., their outputs will be set to zero).
This helps to make the model less reliant on specific neurons, promoting generalization.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
3. model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))
--------------------------------------------------
Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'): This line adds another dense layer, which is the output layer of the model.
units=1: Since this is a binary classification problem, there is only one output neuron that will produce a value between 0 and 1, representing the predicted probability of the positive class.
activation='sigmoid': The activation function used here is sigmoid, which squashes the output between 0 and 1. 
This is ideal for binary classification tasks, where the output is interpreted as a probability (i.e., the probability of the instance belonging to the positive class).
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer, where each neuron in the layer is connected to all neurons in the previous layer.
units=50: The number of neurons in this hidden layer is set to 50.
activation='relu': The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is used, which helps the model learn non-linear relationships and allows the network to perform better.
input_dim=len(tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()): This specifies the number of input features.
In this case, it's set to the number of features produced by the TF-IDF vectorizer (assuming you have already vectorized text data).
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Dropout Layer: It randomly sets a fraction (50% in this case) of input units to 0 at each update during training, helping prevent overfitting. By "dropping out" these neurons, 
it forces the network to generalize better and reduces the chance of the model memorizing the training data.

Dense Layer (Output): A fully connected layer with 1 neuron, which produces a single output.
activation='sigmoid': The Sigmoid activation function is used for binary classification tasks. 
It outputs a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability of belonging to the positive class.

 Optimizer: 'adam'
What is it? The optimizer is responsible for adjusting the model's weights during training to minimize the loss function. The optimizer determines how to update the weights based on the gradients (calculated via backpropagation).
'adam' is an adaptive moment estimation optimizer that combines the benefits of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp. It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by storing both the first-order momentum (the mean) and the second-order momentum (the uncentered variance).
Why use it? It is widely used because it usually performs well in practice, is computationally efficient, and requires little memory. It adapts the learning rate during training, making it well-suited for problems with noisy gradients.
2. Loss function: 'binary_crossentropy'
What is it? The loss function measures how well the model's predictions match the true labels. It calculates the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, and the model aims to minimize this difference.
'binary_crossentropy' is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to classify input data into one of two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam, positive vs. negative).
The binary cross-entropy loss is calculated as:
‚àí
(

‚ãÖ
log

(
ùëù
)
+
(
1
‚àí
ùë¶
)
‚ãÖ
log
‚Å°
(
1
‚àí
ùëù
)
)
‚àí(y‚ãÖlog(p)+(1‚àíy)‚ãÖlog(1‚àíp))
where y is the true label (0 or 1), and p is the predicted probability of the class being 1.
Why use it? This is the standard loss function for binary classification problems because it efficiently penalizes the model's misclassifications.
3. Metrics:
The metrics argument is used to specify how we want to evaluate the performance of the model during training and testing. In this case, four metrics are provided:

'accuracy':

What is it? Accuracy is the most common metric for classification tasks. It measures the percentage of correct predictions.
It is calculated as:
Accuracy
=
Number¬†of¬†correct¬†predictions
Total¬†number¬†of¬†predictions
Accuracy= 
Total¬†number¬†of¬†predictions
Number¬†of¬†correct¬†predictions
‚Äã
 
Why use it? It's a simple, intuitive measure of how often the model's predictions are correct. However, it may not be very informative for imbalanced datasets, where the model might be biased toward the majority class.
tf.keras.metrics.Precision():

What is it? Precision measures how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive. In other words, it calculates the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions made by the model.

It is defined as:
Precision=True¬†Positives/True¬†Positives+False¬†Positives
 
Why use it? Precision is particularly useful when the cost of false positives is high. For example, in medical diagnoses, you may want to minimize false positives (incorrectly identifying a healthy patient as sick).
tf.keras.metrics.Recall():

What is it? Recall measures how many actual positive cases were correctly predicted by the model. It calculates the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives.
It is defined as:
Recall= True¬†Positives 
      --------------------
     True¬†Positives+False¬†Negatives

Why use it? Recall is important when the cost of false negatives is high. For instance, in disease detection, you might want to minimize false negatives (missing a sick patient who needs treatment).
tf.keras.metrics.AUC():

What is it? AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes across various thresholds.
The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (recall) against the False Positive Rate (1 - specificity) for different decision thresholds. 
The AUC score gives you a single number that reflects the overall ability of the model to discriminate between the two classes. The value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect discrimination and 0.5 indicating no discrimination (random guessing).
Why use it? AUC is particularly useful for evaluating the model's performance on imbalanced datasets. It is more informative than accuracy, especially when dealing with classes of unequal sizes.

Summary:

optimizer='adam': Efficiently updates the model weights using adaptive learning rates.
loss='binary_crossentropy': Measures the error for binary classification tasks.
metrics=['accuracy', tf.keras.metrics.Precision(), tf.keras.metrics.Recall(), tf.keras.metrics.AUC()]: Evaluates the model's performance using multiple metrics:
Accuracy for overall correctness.
Precision for the proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
Recall for the proportion of true positives among actual positives.
AUC for the ability to distinguish between classes.
